 # AI Sensor Device Management System – Full-Stack GenAI-Powered Intelligent Infrastructure (END TO END From Scratch)

 - Project Vision
   To design an end-to-end AI-powered intelligent sensor management system that performs real-time monitoring, predictive diagnostics, natural language reporting, and autonomous actions        using a blend of ML, LLMs, MLOps, and cloud-native engineering.   
   The system leverages the LangChain agentic stack, Databricks pipelines, and AWS ecosystem for reliability, scalability, and intelligence at scale.

# Complete Tech Stack Used:-

   - Backend API	FastAPI (Python), REST/gRPC, JWT
   - Microservices	Docker, Kubernetes (EKS), API Gateway ( Convert it in Future)
   - AI/ML Models	TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn
   - LLM + Agentic AI	LangChain, LangGraph, LangSmith, OpenAI, Mistral
   - Prompting & Fine-tuning	PEFT, QLoRA, Hugging Face Transformers
   - ETL Pipelines	Databricks, Delta Lake, Apache Spark
   - Cloud	AWS (S3, Lambda, SageMaker, EC2, SQS )
   - Ops	MLflow, DVC, Weights & Biases, Prefect
   - DevOps/MLOps	GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Terraform, Docker, Argo CD

# Data Ingestion & ETL (via Databricks)
    Streaming ingestion of real-time sensor data (Kafka, MQTT )    
    ETL Pipelines in Databricks:    
       Batch + Streaming jobs    
       Auto-scaling Spark jobs    
       Delta Lake for versioned, queryable data    
    ETL Output stored in:    
      AWS S3 (raw/staged/processed layers)       
      Delta format tables for high performance
🔧 Tools: Apache Spark, Databricks Notebooks, Delta Live Tables

# ML Models & MLOps
  Use Cases:
     Predictive Maintenance     
     Fault Detection     
     Sensor Drift Detection     
  MLOps Workflow:
      - Model training in SageMaker or Databricks  
      - Tracked using MLflow (experiments, metrics, versions)      
      - Packaged in Docker + deployed via SageMaker endpoints or FastAPI      
      - Model Registry + CI/CD with GitHub Actions    
  # LLMs & LLMOps (LangChain + LLM Fine-tuning)
      LLM Use Cases:
        Explain anomaly trends      
        Generate diagnostic reports      
        Summarize sensor history      
        Chat-based queries (“What happened to Sensor X in Zone Y?”)
      
   # LLMOps Workflow:
      Fine-tune LLaMA / Mistral using domain-specific data      
      Use QLoRA or PEFT for memory-efficient fine-tuning      
      Manage with:      
         LangSmith for tracing & debugging      
         LangGraph for agent workflow orchestration      
         LangChain to bind tools, vector DBs, function calling    
   # Prompt Engineering:    
         Chain-of-thought      
         ReAct (reasoning + acting)      
         Tool-use prompting      
         Few-shot examples    
    # Agents (Agentic AI with LangGraph)
         Auto-agent that:    
            Detects issue → Runs diagnostics → Summarizes problem → Suggests actions → Escalates if needed
  🛠 Tools: SageMaker, MLflow, DVC, Weights & Biases
